## Story
After more than a year of online learning, our organization and social skills as students have become a little bit rusty. For first-year university students, the transition to virtual learning has been tough, especially their ability to explore key social aspects of university.

This is why we created ScheDuo, a user-friendly, university exclusive website that allows users to create and share their university timetables with their peers. Users can add and edit their lectures, tutorials, practicals, and other university events on ScheDuo and find like-minded students who have similar timetables and interests as themselves! For students who havenâ€™t had the opportunity to walk across campus from one class to the next, visit some cool buildings, or participate in clubs and events, they can use ScheDuo to find peers to start new in-person university experiences together without being alone.
